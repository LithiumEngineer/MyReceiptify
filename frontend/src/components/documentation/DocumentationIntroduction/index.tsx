                    Receiptify is your all-in-one platform for personal
                    financing. Upload receipts in just one click, and by
                    leveraging OpenCV&apos;s powerful computer vision library,
                    the app will automatically scan your receipt to collect
                    spendings to generate comprehensive spending reports. The
                    app also provides AI-powered personalized spending tips
                    tailored to your spending habits (coming soon) to help you

                    Receiptify is a full-stack application built off of
                    React/Tailwind CSS for frontend, Express.js and Node.js for
                    server backend, and Python for image processing backend.
                    Thanks to the following libraries (and many more) for making
                    this project possible:
